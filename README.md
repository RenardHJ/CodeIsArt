### How to use Yarn

**Yarn should not be necessary to install dependancies since the node_modules folder is on github.**

Please see the [Yarn webpage](https://yarnpkg.com/) to get it installed on your local machine as well as seeing as examples of how to use Yarn.

**Make sure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed before installing Yarn.**

Once Yarn is installed, run "yarn" in order to get all package components.
```
$ yarn
```

Add packages using "yarn add".
```
$ yarn add <PACKAGE NAME>
$ yarn add bootstrap
```

Remove packages using "yarn remove".
```
$ yarn remove <PACKAGE NAME>
$ yarn remove bootstrap
```
