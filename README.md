# Python Portraits
Version: 0.0.3

**[Temporary Website](http://cs.umw.edu/~hrenard/pp/)**

Made for the 2017 UMW Hackathon

The purpose of this project is to create a lightweight web application that allows for python code to be visually represented on a canvas.

**We will be adding a documents folder soon for information not found in this document.**

## How it works

Section Coming Soon

## How to add a drawing algorithm

**Files to edit**
* [index.html](index.html)
* [script.js](scripts/script.js)
* Your drawing algorithm file

### There will be an in-depth guide to creating a new drawing algorithm once we clean up and optimize the code a little. Hold Tight!

## Main ingredients

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - Package manager.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JavaScript library.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.
* [Bootstrap-select](https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/) - jQuery plugin that utilizes Bootstrap's dropdown.js to style and bring additional functionality to standard select elements.
* [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - Scalable vector icons.
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - a library and set of tools that make it easy to use the JavaScript programming language for creative coding.

### How to use Yarn

**Yarn should not be necessary to install dependancies since the node_modules folder is on github.**

Please see the [Yarn webpage](https://yarnpkg.com/) to get it installed on your local machine as well as seeing as examples of how to use Yarn.

**Make sure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed before installing Yarn.**

Once Yarn is installed, run "yarn" in order to get all package components.
```
$ yarn
```

Add packages using "yarn add".
```
$ yarn add <PACKAGE NAME>
$ yarn add bootstrap
```

Remove packages using "yarn remove".
```
$ yarn remove <PACKAGE NAME>
$ yarn remove bootstrap
```
